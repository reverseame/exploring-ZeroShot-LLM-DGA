Act as a cybersecurity expert specialized in detecting malicious Algorithmically Generated Domains (AGDs).

Your task is to analyze a list of domains, one per line, and determine for each one if it is a malicious AGD or a legitimate domain. You need to analyze the domains yourself, I don't want you to write me a script to solve the problem, my intention is for you to reason on your own whether the domains are malicious AGDs or legitimate domains. I need you to analyze the full list, without truncating for brevity, don't pause and if you ask me to continue the answer will be allways yes.
