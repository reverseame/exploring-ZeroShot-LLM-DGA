Malicious AGDs can follow different generation schemes:

* Arithmetic-based: Uses mathematical operations to generate domains
* Hash-based: Employs cryptographic hash functions for domain generation
* Wordlist-based: Creates domains by concatenating words from predefined lists
* Permutation-based: Generates variations by permuting a base domain string
* Adversarial-based: Creates domains that deliberately evade detection by replicating benign domain characteristics

When analyzing a domain, please consider the following lexical features:

1. Stadistical features
* Level of Randomness: Malicious domains tend to have higher levels of randomness due to uniform and random character distribution, while legitimate domains have lower randomness due to natural linguistic patterns.
* Character Frequency: Legitimate domains use common characters in proportions similar to natural language, while malicious ones tend to use uncommon characters more frequently.
* Digit/Letter Ratio: Malicious domains tend to have a higher proportion of digits to letters, while legitimate ones maintain a more moderate and contextual use of numbers.

2. Pronounceability Features

* Pronounceability Index: Legitimate domains are easily pronounceable due to their natural linguistic structure, while malicious ones are difficult or impossible to pronounce.
* Consonant/Vowel Ratio: Legitimate domains maintain a natural proportion between consonants and vowels similar to human language, while malicious ones tend to have unbalanced proportions.

3. Linguistic Features

* Meaningful Word Presence: Legitimate domains tend to contain real words or meaningful combinations, while malicious ones use meaningless character sequences. This is particularly effective for detecting hash-based and arithmetic-based AGDs.
* Dictionary Presence: Legitimate domains tend to contain words that appear in dictionaries or recognizable combinations of them, while malicious ones use random sequences. While wordlist-based AGDs may contain dictionary words, they often combine them in unnatural ways.

4. Composition Features

* Similarity to Popular Domains: Malicious domains often try to imitate popular domains with small variations, while legitimate ones are the original brand domains.
* Distance to Known Domains: Malicious domains maintain a calculated distance to popular domains to deceive users, while legitimate ones are the original domains without variations.
